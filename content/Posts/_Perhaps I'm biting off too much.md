Every day I work on this project I realise just how much I’d underestimated the time and effort it would take me to bring it to completion.

I knew from the start that it's a lot to get done by one person.We’re talking about, scriptwriting, character and environment 3D modelling, all of animation, score and sound design, live action bits, and editting.

But, I felt that I’d done bigger animation projects in the past, so I can handle this. The difference is that what I’d done previously was during high school, without all the commitments of adult life. There is just no time.

I’m still at the storyboarding stage which should go really quickly, relatively speaking, and it's already been months. The only way I see this being done in a timely fashion is by being smarter with how I’m doing the animation itself.

# Maybe it's time to look for corners to cut

It's probably a symptom of pride and ego, but I really feel averse to somehow simplifying the vision. The falaxy follows the lines of “I’m not beholden to anyone else so I can make whatever I want, so why reduce complexity?”

Well, I think lack of time is a good enough reason. I am beholden to time.


# Why not just work on this forever?

I had the fear that I’d get tired or fed up, or burnt out or that I’d start hating the idea before I could finish the project. But I’m still into it even months later. Which is not an attitude that is granted to artists. It's common to hate your own work.

It's not some sign that this is some great idea that will be really good if well executed. 




What I look forward to is making smaller weekly or biweekly projects that let me fail and learn a bit quicker.
