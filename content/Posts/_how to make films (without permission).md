# Be brave

I think creating anything takes a lot of bravery. As I’ve grown old for some strange reason the process of creativity now lies under a layer of anxiety: “it must come out good”, “is this a waste of time?”, “what if someone sees it?”, “I really hope they like it”, “why make this if no one will see it?”, “I will never be good”, “maybe I wasted my youth”. It’s kind of a horrific feeling, but the good news is that it dissipates as soon as you immerse yourself in the process.

And the more often you immerse yourself, the more effortless it becomes to just start. At least I’ve noticed that I’m unlearning these traumatic associations with the process of creating something.

If you can find the courage in yourself to make a little bit of progress on the thing that you are itching to make every day, over time it gets easier, and you will yearn for bigger challenges, bigger leaps. It will take time but I do believe that small acts of bravery add up.

# Be consistent

It is much better to do a little bit of passion work every day than taking a full day once a week. At least for me I find that the anxiety and the pressure builds up as I skip out working on things daily.

By maintaining consistency you are maintaining your momentum, which is huge.

# Use what you have

Play to you strength.

In most cases you don’t need more than you have to create something. If you have access to the Internet you have all the tools necessary to learn a skill for free, practice it, and share.

Every person is unique and everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses. I consider myself a jack of many trades and master of none. And I don’t even expect to become a master of any. But to me being a generalist is the most fun thing ever. Being able to combine skills and creative ways of thinking from various disciplines is magical, and with every new skill I learn I become a better student, so maybe that’s *my* strength or something.

# Break it down

Every scary big-problem mountain is only pile of tiny small-problem pebbles. Keep subdividing your big scary task into smaller parts and you can achieve anything. Well there is also…

# Be selective

Ideas are cheap. I can come up with the most grandiose universe-scale plot in a weekend, but to make that come to life? Oh, buddy. Something like that, could be a film that takes a life-time to make. So you should be a little picky of what you go after.

I think, 100 simpler ideas that you can finish in a week each, have a lot more learning potential than a single big project that will take you 3 years to complete.^[It’s that adage of the pottery teacher, and student who makes 100 pots while all their other peers focus on a single “masterpiece” and where at the end of semester the 100th pot is better than all the originals of any other student? Maybe you’ve heard that one too, idk. But the point quantity can lead to quality.] So try picking things that are realistic and that you find exciting to jump into straight away.

Starting and finishing projects regularly is also a good way to maintain momentum, because you are never stuck in a single point.

# Follow your interest

This is a big one.

Often doubt can lead artists down the path of crowd-pleasing, or you may decide that each next project has to outshine the previous ones in every way.

I think it’s important to do what you love, and the audience that respects that and shares your passion will discover you. Pandering will attract temporary viewership, and I think there is something to be said about originality. It’s hard to be original when you are targeting some sort of demographic. At that point you are generating content, you are almost averaging out, instead of sharing a precise feeling through your art.

Making what you love, what you want to be made, what you feel like has to be made, will lead to more original works, and will attract people who care more genuinely. I really believe that.

# Don’t overthink it

Have trust in yourself, that you can adapt and improvise on the spot without having everything figured out.

At least I find that having things overly-planned only increases anxiety in the long-term. It’s soothing in the moment I write out the whole plan, but the next day, the second something inevitable goes wrong, not according to plan, it feels almost worse than if I had no plan at all.

It’s fine to plan a bit, especially things surrounding the logistics, but over-stucturing your creative decisions can put you in a cage.

A good mindset that I’ve been trying somewhat successfully to adopt is “if you are stuck, action beats thinking”.

There are times of course where you should think before acting, but I do believe that most of the times where you feel something blocking your thinking you can act and improvise your way through most problems far quicker and with less anxiety that trying to come up with an all-considerate plan that will probably go wrong in some way anyway.

# Find the time

This maybe the most practically important, and most difficult.

Of course, time management can be very important. But when I speak of finding time in the adult world, the day job becomes a huge time-… waste, depending on your situation.

If you are in a position where you have to work full-time, pay rent, maybe have dependants, then finding spare time can be the most difficult task.

I cannot possible give any practical advice here, because every person’s situation is so different. But only real way I see of finding more time to do what you love is to find a way to get paid for it. This could look like doing freelance using the skills you have that relate to your current work. Or having a job that is adjacent to your personal creative pursuits. The way I see it, regardless of how you do it, it’s important to try and carve out more time that you allow yourself to create and do what you love. It’s not easy at all.

It can be a life-long challenge to find a way to be paid to do what you love. So all I can say is don’t give up, and keep looking.
